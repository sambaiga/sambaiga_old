This project aims to address this challenge by automating the process of creating and evaluating
deep learning models for EO applications. The project's envisioned goal is to make it easy for companies and
businesses without the extensive experience of developing AI models and EO for their specific
use-cases. Specifically, the project investigates the possibility of generating an annotated
dataset by leveraging satellite imagery and other geo-referenced data such as OSM. It further
describes the process of how to apply deep learning models for object detection on EO imagery
through experimentation. 

The project will: 

1. Develop a pipeline for creating an AI-ready dataset for EO applications by combining satellite imagery and geo-referenced data sources such as OSM.
2. Develop machine learning pipeline for building machine learning models for EO applications with a focus on object detection.
