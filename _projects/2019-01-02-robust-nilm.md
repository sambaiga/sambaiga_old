Energy use is in residential buildings is rapidly increasing across most parts of the world. 
This is the growing concern due to energy and sustainability challenges facing society. 
Therefore, there is a need for reducing energy consumption in residential buildings.

Recently, large-scale deployments of smart meters have sparked the interest towards developing effective non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) solutions for reducing energy consumption in buildings. 
NILM uses smart meter data to infer what end-appliances running in the building and estimate their respective power consumption.
This project is expected to accomplish three main objectives:

1. Investigate and develop robust feature representation for appliance recognition in NILM
2. Explore multilabel-learning for appliance recognition in NILM. 
3. Develop end-to-end NILM and investigate its value propositions in smart-grid.
