    "## Introduction\n",
    "Training machine learning sometimes involves various hyperparameter settings. Performing a hyperparameter search is an integral element in building machine learning models. It consists of attuning different sets of parameters to find the best settings for excellent model performance. It should be remarked that deep neural networks can involve many hyperparameter settings. Getting the best set parameters for such a high dimensional space might a challenging task. Opportunely, different strategies and tools can be used to simplify the process. This post will guide you on how to use Optuna for a hyper-parameter search using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [PyTorch lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning) framework."

    "### Optuna\n",
    "[Optuna](https://optuna.org/) is an open-source hyperparameter optimization framework.  It automates the process of searching for optimal hyperparameter using Python conditionals, loops, and syntax. The optuna library offers efficiently hyper-parameter search in large spaces while pruning unpromising trials for faster results. Using optuna it is possible to parallelize hyperparameter searches over multiple threads or processes without modifying code.\n",
    "The optuna optimization problem consists of three main building blocks; **objective function**, **trial** and **study**. Let consider a simple optimisation problem: *Suppose a rectangular garden is to be constructed using a rock wall as one side of the garden and wire fencing for the other three sides as shown in figure belwo. Given  500m of wire fencing, determine the dimensions that would create a garden of maximum area. What is the maximum area?*"

Then the area of the garden $A= x \\cdot y$. We want to find the maximum possible area subject to the constraint that the total fencing is 500m. The total amount of fencing used will be  $2x+y$.  Therefore, the constraint equation is \n",

Therefore, we will try to determine the maximum value of A(x) for x over the open interval (0,50).\n",
