    "\n",
    "Computational Sustainability focuses on developing computational models, methods, and tools to support policymakers in developing more effective solutions and policies for sustainable development. The advancement of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), particularly Earth Observation (EO) and Artificial intelligence (AI), offer prospects of addressing sustainability challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earth observations (EO) are data and information about the planet’s physical, chemical, and biological systems.  It involves the collection, analysis, and presentation about the status of, and changes in, the natural and human-made environment. The most common sources of EO data include drones,  land stations, and satellites. While drones capture high-resolution images on a small scale, satellites generate growing amounts of multi-resolution and multi-bands imagery and other data sources for the whole Earth. The figure 1 shows multiband imagery from satellites by electromagnetic spectrum.\n",

    "\n",
    "On the other hand, AI is an area of computer science devoted to developing systems that can learn (from data) to make decisions and predictions within specific contexts. Indeed, AI technology can extract deeper insights from datasets than other techniques. Over recently, AI has been used with success in solving complex problems in several domains such as machine translation, computer vision, autonomous cars, to mention a few. Machine learning and specifically, computer vision models provide explicitly useful and practical approaches for analyzing and extracting relevant information from EO imagery data. Recently deep learning models and specifically Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) have proven effective in several computer vision tasks such as object detection, classification, and video processing, image generations, and image captioning, to mention a few. These models could be applied to detect and classify objects from complex EO imagery at a larger scale. The figure 2 explains AI capability for object detection and using computer vision techniques for multibands satellite images. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying these techniques to EO data will make it easy to efficiently automate the recognition of known and unknown patterns at large-scale. This is likely to reveal useful insights and opportunities for addressing sustainability challenges. For instance, AI models could be applied  to perform automated change detection, crop mapping, and yield estimation from high-resolution imagery in a larger-scale. The fusion of EO data and other data sources such as geo-referenced, demographics, and social-network data can be used to facilitate the more targeted developmental challenge. For instance, it has been demonstrated that the AI model can be used to predict the poverty level by analyzing satellite imagery, night lights, and demographic data.  Figure 3 shows the different application in domain.\n",

    "## 2. EO data sources\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many EO data sources made available recently. These data sources offer virtual visualization of any location on earth with resolution ranging from 5 centimeters to 120 meters depending on the instruments of satellites, airbus, or drones. The data sources are published as public or commercial data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. 1 Public EO data providers: \n",
    "The free EO data provide free access to data with a resolution of 10 meters to 120 meters. [Copernicus](https://www.copernicus.eu/en/about-copernicus) and [Landsat](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/) are the famous and largest public satellite data providers. \n",

    "## 4. API for accessing EO imager data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the availability of free and commercial satellite imagery, it is somehow challenging to directly download  and use these data.  Accessing these data requires one to have expertise in satellite imagery. Several API solutions that make it easy to access, download, and use satellite imagery from different sources have been developed to address these challenges. Sentinel Hub API is one of the easily available data API. \n",
