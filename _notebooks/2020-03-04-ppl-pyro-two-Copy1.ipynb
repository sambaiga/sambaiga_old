    "Probability is a mathematical framework for representing uncertainty. It is very applicable in Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence as it allows to make *uncertain statements* and  *reason* in the presence of *uncertainty*. Probability theory allow us to design ML algorithms that take into consideration  of *uncertain* and sometimes *stochastic*  quantities. It further tell us tell us how ML systems should *reason* in the presence of uncertainty. This  is necessary because most things in the world  are uncertain, and thus  ML systems should reason using probabilistic rules. Probability theory can also be used to analyse the behaviour of  ML algorithms probabilistically. Consider evaluating ML classification algorithm using  accuracy metric which is  the probability that the model will give a correct prediction  given an example."

It describe how likely a random variable or set of random variable is to take on each of its possible state. The probability distribution for discrete random variable is called probability mass function (PMF) which measures the probability $X$ takes on the value $x$, denoted denoted as $P(X=x)$.\n",

One of the approach is relay upon lifetime experince of flipping coins in which most coins tend to be fair which implies $p(\\theta) = 0.5$. We can also use various distribution to specify prior density but in practise a most useful distribution is the **beta distribution** parameterized by $a , b > 0$ and defined as:\n",
