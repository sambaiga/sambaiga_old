This specifies the likelihood function. Instead of log transforming the data, we use a LogNormal distribution. The observations are conditionally independent given the latent random variable slope and intercept. To explicitly mark this in Pyro, **plate** statement is used to construct conditionally independent sequences of variables.\n",

The **plate**  statement can be used either sequentially as a generator or in parallel as a context manager. Sequential plate is similar to ``range()``in that it generates a sequence of values. \n",
