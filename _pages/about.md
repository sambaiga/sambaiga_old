I hold a B.sc. Degree in Electronics Science and Communication from the University of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania (2009), and a M.sc. Degree in Telecommunications Engineering from the University of Dodoma, Tanzania, in 2012. 
 
My research interest lies in using machine learning, deep learning, data science, and signal processing to develop computational models, methods, and tools to help industries, organisations and policymakers design more effective solutions and policies for sustainable development and climate change mitigation and adaptation. 
 
Since graduating in 2012, I have been working in research in both academia and industry.
Between 2012 and 2017  I worked as an assistant lecturer at the University of Dodoma, Tanzania,where I was involved in a number of research projects within the context of ICT for development (ICT4D). In 2017, I joined IDLab, imec research group of the University of Ghent, in Belgium as a Machine learning researcher focusing on machine learning techniques applied to energy smart-meter data. I was also involved in the development of machine learning models that analyse data monitored from the internet of things (IoT) devices to detect and classify activities in the smart-homes environment. This opportunity has allowed me to drastically expand my research, data analytics, and machine learning skills. Since Feb 2020, I have been working with Dr. Lucas Pereira of Instituto Superior Técnicoon robust machine learning techniques for energy-systems and their value-proposition in smart-grid.
 
Presently, working as a Data Scientist and Machine learning researcher at CeADAR (UCD), Dublin, Ireland, where I devises and implement data analytics and Artificial Intelligence technical solutions for various application domains. I have recently completed a six-month research project that explores how Satellite imagery data can be combined with geospatial data to automate the process of generating training datasets for building AI models. During this time, I successfully led the team to develop a flexible end-to-end pipeline that combines satellite imagery and geo-referenced data to create annotated datasets and build machine learning models. I am also a key member of the CeADAR team working on the AIREO (AI-Ready Earth Observation training datasets) project in partnership with the European Space Agency (ESA) and ICHEC (Ireland’s Centre for High End Computing) to investigate specifications and best practices for developing Earth-Observation (EO) datasets for AI applications. Currently, I am leading a project on a partnership with utility companies in Ireland on Machine learning for Green Energy. The project aims to develop and test novel machine learning approaches to extract relevant insights from smart meter data and create value-added services that contribute to higher energy efficiency levels. 
 
Although I am a person who takes the initiative, I enjoy working as part of a team. I possess a strong team-work spirit with experience of working in a highly international environment. I have good critical and creative thinking, problem-solving, leadership, and project management skills with excellent scientific writing and presentation skills.
