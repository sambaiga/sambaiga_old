  abstract={To this day, hyperparameter tuning remains a cumbersome task in Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) research, as researchers and practitioners are forced to invest a considerable amount of time in this task. This paper proposes adaptive weighted recurrence graph blocks (AWRG) for appliance feature representation in event-based NILM. An AWRG block can be combined with traditional deep neural network architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks for appliance recognition. Our approach transforms one cycle per activation current into an weighted recurrence graph and treats the associated hyper-parameters as learn-able parameters. We evaluate our technique on two energy datasets, the industrial dataset LILACD and the residential PLAID dataset. The outcome of our experiments shows that transforming current waveforms into weighted recurrence graphs provides a better feature representation and thus, improved classification results. It is concluded that our approach can guarantee uniqueness of appliance features, leading to enhanced generalisation abilities when compared to the widely researched V-I image features. Furthermore, we show that the initialisation parameters of the AWRG’s have a significant impact on the performance and training convergence.},

  journal = {Energies},
  abstract = {The advance in energy-sensing and smart-meter technologies have motivated the use of a Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), a data-driven technique that recognizes active end-use appliances by analyzing the data streams coming from these devices. NILM offers an electricity consumption pattern of individual loads at consumer premises, which is crucial in the design of energy efficiency and energy demand management strategies in buildings. {Appliance classification, also known as load identification is an essential sub-task for identifying the type and status of an unknown load from appliance features extracted from the aggregate power signal}. Most of the existing work for appliance recognition in NILM uses a single-label learning strategy which, assumes only one appliance is active at a time. This assumption ignores the fact that multiple devices can be active simultaneously and requires a perfect event detector to recognize the appliance. In~this~paper proposes the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based multi-label learning approach, which~links multiple loads to an observed aggregate current signal. Our approach applies the Fryze power theory to decompose the current features into active and non-active components and use the Euclidean distance similarity function to transform the decomposed current into an image-like representation which, is used as input to the CNN. Experimental results suggest that the proposed approach is sufficient for recognizing multiple appliances from aggregated measurements.}

  abstract  = {Appliance recognition is one of the vital sub-tasks of NILM in which a machine learning classier is used to detect and recognize active appliances from power measurements. The performance of the appliance classifier highly depends on the signal features used to characterize the loads. Recently, different appliance features derived from the voltage–current (V–I) waveforms have been extensively used to describe appliances. However, the performance of V–I-based approaches is still unsatisfactory as it is still not distinctive enough to recognize devices that fall into the same category. Instead, we propose an appliance recognition method utilizing the recurrence graph (RG) technique and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We introduce the weighted recurrent graph (WRG) generation that, given one-cycle current and voltage, produces an image-like representation with more values than the binary output created by RG. Experimental results on three different sub-metered datasets show that the proposed WRG-based image representation provides superior feature representation and, therefore, improves classification performance compared to V–I-based features},

  abstract  = {The rapid urbanization of developing countries coupled with explosion in construction of high rising buildings and the high power usage in them calls for conservation and efficient energy program. Such a program require monitoring of end-use appliances energy consumption in real-time. The worldwide recent adoption of smart-meter in smart-grid, has led to the rise of Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM); which enables estimation of appliance-specific power consumption from building’s aggregate power consumption reading. NILM provides households with cost-effective real-time monitoring of end-use appliances to help them understand their consumption pattern and become part and parcel of energy conservation strategy. This paper presents an up to date overview of NILM system and its associated methods and techniques for energy disaggregation problem. This is followed by the review of the state-of-the art NILM algorithms. Furthermore, we review several performance metrics used by NILM researcher to evaluate NILM algorithms and discuss existing benchmarking framework for direct comparison of the state of the art NILM algorithms. Finally, the paper discuss potential NILM use-cases, presents an overview of the public available dataset and highlight challenges and future research directions.},

  abstract  = {Cellular coverage is often a challenge in low population density and low income rural areas of the developing world like Tanzania. This is because big Telecom companies defer from deploying their expensive infrastructure in these areas fearing operations cost. It is proposed that the use of cellular open source technology as the basis for a new rural cellular network can go a long way in meeting this challenge by providing coverage in rural areas whilst simultaneously bringing down the cost of communication. This paper provides survey of recent open source cellular technologies. It further presents a prototype based on Open BTS for cellular connectivity in developing countries. In lab performance test for the proposed prototype confirm the feasibility of deploying cellular network based on open source technologies as an alternative to conventional mobile operator networks in a bid to solve the challenge.}

This paper evaluates two existing handover algorithms namely A2-A4-RSRQ and A3-RSRP. Based on the analysis of the optimal settings of both algorithms, the performances of the selected algorithms were compared and the results proved that A2-A4-RSRQ performs better than A3-RSRP. A2-A4-RSRQ handover algorithm is able to maintain acceptable throughput and handover delay as per 3GPP specification.}

  abstract  = {The need for effective and efficient monitoring, evaluation and control of water quality in Lake Victoria Basin (LVB) has become more demanding in this era of urbanization, population growth and climate change and variability. Traditional methods that rely on collecting water samples, testing and analyses in water laboratories are not only costly but also lack capability for real-time data capture, analyses and fast dissemination of information to relevant stakeholders for making timely and informed decisions. In this paper, a Water Sensor Network (WSN) system prototype developed for water quality monitoring in LVB is presented. The development was preceded by evaluation of prevailing environment including availability of cellular network coverage at the site of operation. The system consists of an Arduino microcontroller, water quality sensors, and a wireless network connection module. It detects water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, and electrical conductivity in real-time and disseminates the information in graphical and tabular formats to relevant stakeholders through a web-based portal and mobile phone platforms. The experimental results show that the system has great prospect and can be used to operate in real world environment for optimum control and protection of water resources by providing key actors with relevant and timely information to facilitate quick action taking.}

  abstract  = {he infiltration of Counterfeit Drugs (CDs) in the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain (PSC) is
adversely affecting health sectors in their efforts to provide quality health services to the
public. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), over 30 percent of anti-malaria
drugs sold in the developing countries are substandard. Furthermore, the Confederation of
Tanzania Industries (CTI) estimated that 60 percent of the medicines imported into Tanzania
are counterfeits. Several initiatives have been taken in an attempt to curb the selling of CDs.
However, the effectiveness of these initiatives remains questionable. There is an urgent need
to formulate more effective strategies to secure the PSC by involving all stakeholders. In this
regard, technology-based solution could be an effective uptake in mitigating CDs. This study
assesses how the technology-based system can secure PSC and enable medical drugs
verification in Tanzania. The proven adoption of Information and Communication

However for decades, water quality monitoring and evaluation in
developing countries like Tanzania have depended on costly, time- and labor-intensive
on-site sampling and data collection and transport to laboratories for evaluation.
Emerging technologies like Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) can be used to provide
relatively inexpensive, coordinated, intelligent networks allowing a well coordinated
and continuous monitoring of water quality. This dissertation investigates the
application of WSN in monitoring water quality and propose a low cost water quality
monitoring system based on a WSN, which is to be applied to monitor water quality
around Lake Victoria basin. Appropriate open source WSN technologies are identified
and the proposed network is then analyzed through simulation using NS-2 with the aim
of estimating the maximum number of nodes, maximum number of sources nodes and
transmit power level that could be used while still achieving a desirable network
performance. Using Radio Mobile software, this dissertation has demonstrated that long
distant WSN link is possible in Musoma with link margin greater than 10dB and
Fresnel zone greater than 0.6F.}
