### Earth Observation python libraries 

- [Shapely](https://github.com/Toblerity/Shapely) a Python package for set-theoretic analysis and manipulation of planar features using (via Python’s ctypes module) functions from the well known and widely deployed GEOS library
- [Fiona](https://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona) focuses on reading and writing data in standard Python IO style and relies upon familiar Python types and protocols such as files, dictionaries, mappings, and iterators instead of classes specific to GDAL's OpenGIS Reference Implementation (OGR). Fiona can read and write real-world data using multi-layered GIS formats and zipped virtual file systems and integrates readily with other Python GIS packages such as pyproj, Rtree, and Shapely.
- [Geojson](https://github.com/jazzband/geojson)
Python bindings and utilities for GeoJSON a format for encoding a variety of geographic data structures.
- [Geopandas](https://geopandas.org/) an open source project to make working with geospatial data in python easier.  GeoPandas extends the datatypes used by pandas to allow spatial operations on geometric types. It uses shapely to perform geometric operations and further  depends on [fiona]() for file access, [descartes]() and [matplotlib]() for plotting.The goal of GeoPandas is to make working with geospatial data in python easier. 
- [Rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) a python raster data library – expressing GDAL’s data model using fewer non-idiomatic extension classes and more idiomatic Python types and protocols, while performing as fast as GDAL’s Python bindings.
- [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/) builds on the data wrangling strengths of the Python ecosystem and the mapping strengths of the leaflet.js library. Manipulate your data in Python, then visualize it in on a Leaflet map via folium.
- [Earthpy](https://earthpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)
EarthPy builds upon the functionality developed for raster data (rasterio) and vector data (geopandas) in Python and simplifies the code needed to
- [Pyosmium](https://github.com/osmcode/pyosmium) a library to process OSM files in different formats. It is a wrapper of the C++ library osmium and allows fast and efficent sequential processing of OpenStreetMap data.
- [Eo-learn](https://github.com/sentinel-hub/eo-learn)  is a collection of open source Python packages that have been developed to seamlessly access and process spatio-temporal image sequences acquired by any satellite fleet in a timely and automatic manner
- [Solaris](https://solaris.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)  An open source ML pipeline for overhead imagery by CosmiQ Works.
