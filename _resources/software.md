### Machine learning python packages
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/):  A free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.
  

### Deep learning python frameworks
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/): An open-source software library for Machine Intelligence
- [Pytorch](http://pytorch.org/): A deep learning framework that puts Python first.
- [Keras](https://keras.io/): The Python Deep Learning library.
- [Mxnet](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/): A Flexible and Efficient Library for Deep Learning
- [Pytorch-lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning) Lightning is a way to organize your PyTorch code to decouple the science code from the engineering. It's more of a PyTorch style-guide than a framework.

### Probabilistic programming
- [Edward ](http://edwardlib.org/): A library for probabilistic modeling, inference, and criticism
- [Pyro](http://pyro.ai/): a universal probabilistic programming language (PPL) written in Python and supported by PyTorch on the backend.
- [Pymc3](http://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/getting_started): Probabilistic programming with support for Bayesian Modeling and Probabilistic Machine Learning.

### Optisimastion library
- [Optuna](https://optuna.org/) An open source hyperparameter optimization framework to automate hyperparameter search
