### Machine learning python packages
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/):  A free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.
  

### Deep learning python frameworks
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/): An open-source software library for Machine Intelligence
- [Pytorch](http://pytorch.org/): A deep learning framework that puts Python first.
- [Keras](https://keras.io/): The Python Deep Learning library.
- [Mxnet](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/): A Flexible and Efficient Library for Deep Learning
- [Pytorch-lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning) Lightning is a way to organize your PyTorch code to decouple the science code from the engineering. It's more of a PyTorch style-guide than a framework.
- [Fastai](https://docs.fast.ai/) A deep learning library which provides practitioners with high-level components that can quickly and easily provide state-of-the-art results in standard deep learning domains, and provides researchers with low-level components that can be mixed and matched to build new approaches.

### Probabilistic programming
- [Edward ](http://edwardlib.org/): A library for probabilistic modeling, inference, and criticism
- [Pyro](http://pyro.ai/): a universal probabilistic programming language (PPL) written in Python and supported by PyTorch on the backend.
- [Pymc3](http://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/getting_started): Probabilistic programming with support for Bayesian Modeling and Probabilistic Machine Learning.

### Optisimastion library
- [Optuna](https://optuna.org/) An open source hyperparameter optimization framework to automate hyperparameter search

### Data labelling tools

- [Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT)](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/cvat) A free, online, interactive video and image annotation tool for computer vision.
- [Label Studio](https://labelstud.io/)A self-contained Web application for multi-typed data labeling and exploration. It allow users to easily connect any ML framework  enabling pre-labeling,autolabeling
online learning, active learning and running production-ready prediction service. 
- [Labelme](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme) A graphical image annotation tool for polygon, rectangle, circle, line, point and image-level. 
- [Universal Data Tool](https://universaldatatool.com/) An open-source tool and library for creating and labeling datasets of images, audio, text, documents and video in an open data format.
  MIT License. 
- [Universal Data Tool](https://universaldatatool.com/) An open-source tool and library for creating and labeling datasets of images, audio, text, documents and video in an open data format.
  MIT License. 
- [MyVision](https://github.com/heartexlabs/awesome-data-labeling) A free online image annotation tool used for generating computer vision based ML training data. It is designed with the user in mind, offering features to speed up the labelling process and help maintain workflows with large datasets.
- [Curve](https://github.com/microsoft/VoTT) An open-source tool to help label anomalies on time-series data. It is designed to support plugin, so one can equip Curve with customized and powerful functions to help label effectively.
- [CrowdCurio](https://github.com/CrowdCurio/time-series-annotator) An open-source tool to help label anomalies on time-series data. It is designed to support plugin, so one can equip Curve with customized and powerful functions to help label effectively.
